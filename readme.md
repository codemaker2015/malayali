Ever wondered what it would be like to program for the web in Malayalam?
This wonder is what drove the creation of Malayali.
With it you can start programming for the web today in Malayalam.

Underneath the hood, it translates your code to it's ECMAscript equivalent which is then interpreted and ran by the browser.
